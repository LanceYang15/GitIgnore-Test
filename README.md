# GitIgnore-Test
Console application, figuring out how to use the .gitignore file. SUCCESSFULLY ignored a class file from using the .gitignore file. First added onto the git ignore file the class/file I wanted to ignore, then pushed onto github. Then created my class/file and went on with the project. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Must add the ignore file first and push onto github before creating the file or class for the project.

## Steps taken:
  * [1] open the git ignore file
  * [2] go to the bottom/end and add the header "# file(s) to ignore"
  * [3] below the header add the file name (including the pathway) in my case it was GitIgnoreTest/GitIgnoreTest/Hide.cs
  * [4] push onto github

## Disclaimer
This is what worked for me, it may not work for you. 

## Technology Used
  * C#
